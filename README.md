# fidle

Fidle is social Media build Application built
natively for Android and iOS using React Native.


It is still under development and does not yet 
have many features. 

The app uses NodeJS and Express server as its 
backend and MongoDB as its NoSQL Database, while
using React Native for the frontend.


The app still lacks standard security protocols
in securing users data or in its communication 
protocols. 

Everyone is free to suggest changes or reach me 
if they want to startover the project with me
on building a free open-source platform supporting
free speech.
